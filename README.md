## Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to create a dynamic dashboard that allows us to visualize data collected pertaining the bacterial species found in the navels of our volunteers. With our dropdown menu, we can view each subject IDs information along with the type of bacteria living in their navel. We can view the frequency of each bacterial sample collected with our horizontal bar chart and bubble chart.
